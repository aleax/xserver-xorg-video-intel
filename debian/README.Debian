xserver-xorg-video-intel (2:2.13.0-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Starting from 2.10, the Intel X driver depends on a kernel driver for
    mode setting (that's called KMS). The corresponding kernel option is
    CONFIG_DRM_I915, and is enabled in Debian kernels.
  * To enable KMS, either of those should be sufficient:
     + /etc/modprobe.d/i915-kms.conf should contain:
         options i915 modeset=1
     + CONFIG_DRM_I915_KMS=y should be set in the kernel config.
  * If you have issues with this driver, the "vesa" or "fbdev" drivers
    may be useful fallbacks.
