Description: X.Org X server -- Intel i8xx, i9xx display driver (modesetting)
 This package is a development snapshot, it should be considered experimental.
 Please use xserver-xorg-video-i810 instead if you have any doubts.
 .
 This package provides the development modesetting driver for the  Intel i8xx 
 and i9xx family of chipsets, including i810, i815, i830, i845, 
 i855, i865, i915, and i945 series chips.
 .
 This modesetting branch is designed to provide more control over the modes
 available to the driver, without having to depend on the VideoBIOS.  It will 
 write extra debugging text to the Xorg log file. The modesetting version may
 become the stable i810 in the future but is provided here for your testing 
 convenience.  Please use the stable i810 driver instead if you do not want 
 to experiment with this driver.
 .
 This driver is still under heavy development and should therefore be 
 considered experimental.  If in doubt, use the stable driver, 
 xserver-xorg-video-i810, instead.
